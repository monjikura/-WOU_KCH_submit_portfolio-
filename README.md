8883 gives the A089840-index of the nonrecursive Catalan automorphism which is formed from A089840[n] by applying it to the left subtree of a binary tree and leaving the right-hand side subtree intact

If the count of fixed points of the automorphism A089840[n] is given by sequence f, then the count of fixed points of the automorphism A089840[A123694(n)] is given by CONV(f,A000108) (where CONV stands for convolution). See also the comments at A122200.
